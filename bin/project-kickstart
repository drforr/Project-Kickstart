=head1 DESCRIPTION

Keeping a perl project up-to-date can be a significant challenge. This tool
integrates with your existing project and git repository (SVN and CVS later on)
to help keep all of your project metadata in sync.

It uses Git-style commands, so if you're familiar with file manipulation in Git,
you should be able to adapt to C<project-kickstart> easily. For instance, if you
want to add a library file, C<project-kickstart add My::Module::Plugin> will
do the trick.

It creates C<lib/My/Module/Plugin.pm> from a template, adding C<Module/> if the
directory doesn't exist. It also adds it to C<MANIFEST> and performs C<git add>
on the filename so it doesn't get lost.

Adding a test file will invoke even more magic, if your test files happen to
be numbered sequentially. You can add C<t/02-core.t> and it will renumber the
original C<t/02-base.t> through C<t/11-format.t> out of the way, do the
appropriate C<git rename> commands and update the C<MANIFEST> as well.

Other commands will use L<PPI> to scour your library directories for modules
that you forgot to add to C<Makefile.PL>, or (if you use L<Locale::Maketext> in
the recommended way) update your English-language localization files with the
latest translations.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

You can configure C<project-kickstart> in several ways. The first, and the
recommended way, is to use the git-like command
C<project-kickstart global user.email="me@example.com"> to set the basic
parameters such as C<user.name> and C<user.email> that you can then use for
C<project-kickstart create My::Module>.

The second way is to set C<KICKSTART_EMAIL> and C<KICKSTART_AUTHOR> in your
environment beforehand. Finally, you can use the command-line parameters
C<--author> and C<--email> to set the module author and email address. Of course
the easiest thing to do is set up configuration once and not worry about it
afterward.
