Project-Kickstart

Moving files around in your perl project can be a tricky business. It's not so
much the 'mv' command as forgetting to tell git that the repository's changed,
updating the MANIFEST or having to continually shuffle t/03-foo.t around.

project-kickstart will help you with that. Instead of 'mv t/03-foo.t t/05-foo.t'
and doing the whole 'git mv' after the fact, just type
'project-kickstart mv 03-foo.t 05-foo.t'. This will do the actual 'mv' command,
run 'git mv' on the repository, update MANIFEST and shuffle around the other
t/ files to keep the existing files in order.
